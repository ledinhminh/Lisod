# This file describes the tests have been done for Liso server.

1. SMOKE test
   1) Test goal: server compiles with no error and can return message from the
      client
   2) Test procedures:
      a) compile programs
         Command: make
      b) run server
         Command: ./lisod 8080 4443 /tmp/lisod.log /tmp/lisod.lock /tmp/www
                  /tmp/cgi/flaskr.py /tmp/priv.key /tmp/cert.crt 
      c) run client
         Command: ./echo_client localhost 8080
         Note: if getting connect error, see Known issue #1.
      d) test echo function
         Command: 'this a SMOKE test'
         and see the same string get returned.

2. Functional test
   1) Test goal: server can accept multiple connections concurrently
   2) Test procedures:
      a) run step a), b) of SMOKE test
      b) open three client windows, run test c) of SMOKE test
      c) type message from each window and see return message, repeat several
         times.
      d) open lisod.log and check all clients are accepted and the order of
         message is as the order when they are inputted.

3. Stress test
   1) Test goal: test the maximum connections server can handle
   2) Test procedures:
      a) run step a), b) of SMOKE test
      b) run cp1.checker.py
         Command: ./cp1_checker.py localhost 8080 5 10 4 1000
      c) see test return 'Success!' and view lisod.log.

4. Memory leak test
   1) Test goal: to make sure there is no memory leak in the program
   2) Run command: valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes ./lisod 8081 4443
   lisod.log lisod.lock www cgi priv cert
   3) And see the test report returned by valgrind

5. Known issues
   1) localhost not working on cluster machine
      Solution: replace 'localhost' with the IP address of the machine
                type '/sbin/ifconfig | grep 'inet addr'' to get IP address
   2) In stress test, if number of connections exceeds certain value, it returns
      error 'Too many open files'. In my test, the number is 1020.
